# Dishooks - Send Discord messages from your Unity game

Dishooks makes it easy for everyone to send messages and embeds to Discord directly from your Unity game, without having to host anything or even use a Discord bot. It's a simple, lightweight, and easy to use library that works with Unity.

## Features
### Out-of-the-box
Set-up is simple - make a webhook for your Discord channel in the app, copy it and paste it into Unity, and you're good to go. Sending a message is as easy as calling `Dishook.Send(message);`. No hosting or Discord bots required.

### Fully customizable
Sending messages and rich embeds is straightforward. Use the built-in wrapper for simplicity, or build the webhooks yourself from scratch. Dishooks supports all the features of Discord webhooks, including embeds, attachments, and more.

### Webhook objects
Webhook configurations can be created as a Scriptable Object so you easily can organize them and use the right sender for the right message. You can also create webhooks at runtime, and use them to send messages.

### Comes with multiple examples and documentation
A complete example scene and documentation included. Email support in English and Swedish if any problems would occur.

### File support 
Dishooks supports sending files to Discord. You can send files from your computer, or from the web. You can also send files from your Unity project, such as screenshots or other files.
